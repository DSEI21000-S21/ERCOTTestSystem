## README

This repository contains all the relevant codes, data files, scripts, and documentation for the ERCOT Project tasks carried out under Iowa State University's "ERCOT Contract" with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).

This repository is organized in the following way:

1. The ERCOT_Test_Systems folder contains all relevant data, scripts, and code pertaining to the development of ERCOT Test Systems.

2. The TESAgents folder contains scripts to compile AMES, and to run AMES along with other TES Agents (with FNCS as the network co-simulator). NetLoadForecastDAM.py and NetLoadForecastRTM.py are TES Agents meant to provide load forecasts for the AMES Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and Real-Time Markets (RTM) respectively.

3. The License folder describes the BSD 3-Clause ("New" or "Revised") License under which the materials at this repository are being released as Open Source Software.

Appendices of the below published paper provides necessary details of ERCOT Test System implementation.
