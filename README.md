## README

This repository contains all the relevant codes, data files, scripts, and documentation for the ERCOT Project tasks carried out under Iowa State University's "ERCOT Contract" with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).

This repository is organized in the following way:

1. The Documentation folder contains the relevant documentation made for the project tasks and for the software implementation. AMES V5.0 SCUC/SCED Optimization Documentation can be accessed at https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/econ_workingpapers/109/.

2. The ERCOT_Test_Systems folder contains all relevant data, scripts, and code pertaining to the development of ERCOT Test Systems.

3. The TESAgents folder contains scripts to compile AMES, and to run AMES along with other TES Agents (with FNCS as the network co-simulator). As of now, loadforecast.py is a TES Agent meant to provide load forecasts for the AMES Day-Ahead Market (DAM).

4. The next two folders contain zipped versions of AMES (V3.2) and AMES (V5.0), respectively.

5. The License folder describes the BSD 3-Clause ("New" or "Revised") License under which the materials at this repository are being released as Open Source Software.
